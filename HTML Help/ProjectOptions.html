    <h1>Project Options</h1>

    <p>This dialogue allows you to specify various optiosn for the specifiy project you
    are compiling.</p>

    <img src="Images/ProjectOptions.gif" alt=""/>

    <li><strong>Extension Warning Exclusions</strong> - This option allow you to define a
    semi-colon (;) separated list of file <em>wildcard (only the * is supported but in
    multiple positions)</em> extensions for resource files you DO NOT want warnings about
    where they are not bound to the project using an RC file. NOTE: Even with these
    warning disabled these resource files are still zipped to the archive.</li>

    <li><strong>Increment Build On Compile</strong> - This increments the build number of
    the compiled project after a successful compilation.</li>

    <li><strong>Copy Version Information From</strong> - This has been updated to
    reference an executable file rather than the target of another project in the project
    group. This then allow you to get the version number from another project executable
    even if its compiled with another version of the compiler.</li>

    <h2>Version Information</h2>

    <a>Due to problems with the Open Tools API in Delphi XE2 I have been forced to
    manage version information for the project manually. The reaso for this is that
    although you can get the version information for a project in XE2 and change the
    value, these values do not end up in the compiled project UNLESS you open the
    project&#39;s options dialogue and press OK. If you don&#39;t do this, the changes
    are even lost of closing and saving the project.</a>

    <p><strong>Enable ITHelper Version Control</strong> - This option enables the creation
    of a resource file managed by ITHelper. You need to ensure that the IDE does not
    include version information in the project&#39;s main resource as you will get
    duplicate version resource messages.</p>

    <p>The <strong>Major</strong>, <strong>Minor</strong>, <strong>Release</strong> and
    <strong>Build</strong> numbers refer to the version information and if this is enabled
    it is these numfers that are incremented or changes through the increment on compile
    and copy version inforamtion items above.</p>

    <p>The table below allow you to specify additionak version information. Note: The
    FileVersion items is automatically updated when the numbers above are changed.</p>

    <p><strong>Include Resource In Project</strong> - This make ITHelper add the resource
    files (RC), which it builds, to be included in the project and therefore managed by
    the project</p>

    <p><strong>Compile the Resource with BRC32</strong> - This pre-compiles the RC file
    into a RES file. You only need to use this on early compilers where the IDE does not
    do this for you or where you want to manage the RES file manually.</p>

    <p><strong>Resource Path Name (exc Ext)</strong> - This is the name of the resource
    (RC) file that ITHelper will create which will contain the version information and
    optionally be included in the project. You MUST not include the extension and you can
    specify relative paths (not full paths). The relativity is with respect to the
    main project file.</p>

    <h2>Note</h2>

    <p>These project settings are stored in a <code>ProjectName.ITHelper ini file in the
    same directory as the project.</code></p>
