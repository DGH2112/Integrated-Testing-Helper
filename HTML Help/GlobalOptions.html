    <h1>Global Options</h1>

    <p>This dialogue allows you to configure the global options that affect the way the
    application is configured and is applicable to all projects.</p>

    <p><strong>Group Messages into their own tab</strong> - This places the messages
    that are output by the add-in and the external tools, to be output into a dedicated
    message tab rather than among the standard compiler messages.</p>

    <p><strong>Auto Scroll Messages</strong> - This option scrolls the message view to
    the last message automatically as they are added;</p>

    <p><strong>Zip Executable</strong> - Here you can now specify the command line
    archiving executable you wish to use to "Zip" the project information;</p>

    <p><strong>Zip Parameters</strong> - Here you can now specify the the archiving
    parameters to be passed to the above executable. There are three macros which are
    expanded by the system and they are as follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>$REPSONSEFILE$</em> This is the file name containing a list of all the
      files to be zipped which is created by the Integrated Testing Helper. Used in
      combination with the @ switch of WinZip or 7Zip;</li>
      <li><em>$ZIPFILE$</em> This is the name of the zip file specified for the current
      compiling project&#39;s archive (see Zip Options);</li>
      <li><em>$FILELIST$</em> This inserts a space separated list of double quoted files
      names into the command line for zipping.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Switch to Messages after a Successful Compile</strong>This option
    switches to the helper messages if the last compile was successful.</p>

    <p><strong>Clear Messages After Period of Time (seconds)</strong> - This allows
    the message list to be cleared if the last compile was more than the specified
    period of time ago. If you do not want the messages cleared set this to 0
    (zero).</p>

    <h2>Shortcuts</h2>

    <p>This list view allows you wo assign IDE shortcuts to all the actions that the
    Integrated Testing Helper defines in the IDE.</p>

    <p>To assign a shortcut, select the action in the list, enter the shortcut in the
    shortcut edit control below by pressing the shortcut combination you want to use and
    then pressing the <strong>Assign</strong> button.</p>

    <h2>Configure Check for Updates</h2>

    <p>This option allows you to configure the Check for Updates on application startup by
    enabling this option (disabled by default) and specifying the interval between checks
    in days.</p>

    <p>The next time the application is started (if Check for Updates has never been run
    before) the application will check the internet for updates.</p>

    <h2>Note</h2>

    <p>These settings are stored in a single INI file named
    <code>ITHelper#### Settings for USERNAME on COMPUTER.ini</code> in your Application
    Data directory under your profile.</p>
