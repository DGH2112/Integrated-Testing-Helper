   <h1>Before and After Compilation Tools</h1>

   <p>The same dialogue is used for both the before and after tools. In this dialogue you
   can configure command line tools to be run before or after each project
   compilation.</p>

   <p>For instance, you might want to run a set of unit tests before compiling the code (
   if you use project dependencies, this works well) and run deployment code after, say
   building a setup programme for installation, after compilation.</p>

   <p>If you press the Add button or select an existing item and press Edit you will be
   presented with the below dialogue for editing the information associated with a
   tool.</p>

   <img src="Images/ProgrammeInfo.gif" alt=""/>

   <p><strong>Title</strong> - This is a descriptive title you can enter to help you
   understand what the tool does, especially if you run the same executable / batch files
   multiple times but for different reasons.</p>

   <p><strong>Programme</strong> - This is the executable or batch file you want to run.
   It does not need double quotes if the file name has spaces.</p>

   <p><strong>Parameters</strong> - These should the any parameters your executable or
   batch file requires to run. You do need to place double quotes around parameters that
   have spaces in them.</p>

   <p><strong>Working Directory</strong> - This is the directory where the application
   should be run from and act as the applications current directory. This also does not
   need double quotes for paths with spaces.</p>

   <p><strong>Starting Window State</strong> - This is not applicable to this
   application.</p>

   <p>The above dialogue allows the use of a number of macros that are expanded by the
   system. These have been implemented to allow the information to be more portable in
   line with moving all the project information into their own INI files along side the
   project file. The available marcos as as follows:</p>

   <ul>
     <li><em>{$PROJDRIVE$}</em>: This is expanded to be the drive letter and colon of the
     project file;</li>
     <li><em>{$PROJPATH$}</em>: This is expanded to be the drive and path of the project
     file with a trailing backslash.</li>
   </ul>

   <p>This dialogue remembers its size and position separately for both the before and
   after tools.</p>

   <p>Like the <a href="ProjectOptions.html">Project Options</a> this information is
   stored in an INI file with the extension .ITHelper along side the project file.</p>
