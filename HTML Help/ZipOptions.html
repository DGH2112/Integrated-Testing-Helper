    <h1>Zip Options</h1>

    <p>This dialogue allows you to configure the zipping of all the project&#39;s files
    into a ZIP file using an external command line ZIP utility like WinZip or 7Zip. The
    command line ZIP utility is configured in the <a href="GlobalOptions.html">Global
    Options</a> dialogue.</p>

    <p><strong>Enable Zipping</strong> - This enables the zipping of the project&#39;s
    files after a successful compilation.</p>

    <p><strong>Zip Path</strong> - This is a base path from which all relative path in the
    zip file will be referenced.</p>

    <p><strong>Zip Filename</strong> - This is the path to the zip file where you want the
    information to be archived.</p>

    <p><strong>Additional Files</strong> - This is a list of file names or patterns that
    can be used by the ZIP utility to add additional files to the zip archive that are not
    part of the project.</p>

    <p><strong>Patterns to Exclude</strong> - This is a list if wildcard patterns that
    will be passed to the zipping utility and will be excluded from the zipping
    process.</p>

    <p>This dialogue can accept the same macros that are defined in the
    <a href="ProjectOptions.html">Project Options</a> dialogue.</p>

    <p>This dialogue remembers its size and position.</p>

    <p>Like the <a href="ProjectOptions.html">Project Options</a> this information is
    stored in an INI file with the extension <code>.ITHelper</code> along side the project
    file.</p>
